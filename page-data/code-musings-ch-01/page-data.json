There is a distinct possibility that at some point I will get it wrong. This is all part of the learning process and growth process. I will do my best to keep things updated as I continue learning, and will release update blogs if I think the issue is big enough to warrant talking about more in depth.</p>\n<p>Early on in the blog I will likely be talking a lot about Angular, c#.net, and core web things. But I hope that in time I will cover a wide variety of topics spanning everything from design to code. </p>\n<p>You may ask, “Why start with Angular and c#.net?” At the core, the topics on this blog will cover whatever is relevant to me at the time, and as I start this blog my job centers on these technologies. And to be clear, I am still pretty new to both of these pieces of tech, so go easy on me and come along for this learning journey and ride. </p>\n<p>I look forward to learning and growing with all of my readers (That’s you!). I hope you enjoy it, but maybe more importantly I hope you learn something.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Code Musings Chapter 01","date":"September 24, 2019","description":"Introduction to the blog.
